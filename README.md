### **Project Description: Property Management Web Application**

This project is a comprehensive web-based property management system developed as part of the CS425 Database Organization course. It is designed to simplify the interaction between renters and property agents through a unified digital platform that supports key operations like property listing, user registration, booking management, and real-time updates.

The application is built using the **Flask web framework** for the backend, coupled with a **MySQL database** for persistent data storage. It features a user-friendly interface that allows two types of users—**renters** and **agents**—to access different dashboards based on their roles. Renters can view available properties, make bookings, and manage their profiles, while agents can add new listings, manage current ones, and track user activity.

The system ensures secure access with login functionality and session handling. Property details, user information, and booking records are stored and retrieved dynamically from the database. A robust schema supports normalization, relationship integrity, and efficient querying.

A detailed **video demo** included in the project shows a complete walkthrough of the system—from login and dashboard views to property browsing and data management. This visual guide provides an overview of the application's capabilities and ease of use.

In addition to the codebase, the project contains supporting files such as sample datasets, PDF documentation (Phase-1 and Phase-2 planning), and required Java libraries (e.g., MySQL JDBC Connector) that were used during development and testing.

This project demonstrates the practical application of database design principles, backend logic, and user interface integration. It can serve both as a learning tool for full-stack development and as a foundation for real-world real estate management applications.
